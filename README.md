An independent research project investigating non-comparison-based sorting through mathematical reasoning and empirical analysis. Some proofs and experiments are currently incomplete and will be finalized in future work.

The algorithm is largely theoretical, leaning heavily on mathematics and combinatorics, and is not intended for practical use. However, it reveals an interesting structural pattern worth exploring.
